FunWithSound
============

Library intended to make it easy to make music using [Processing](http://processessing.org) and [Beads](http://www.beadsproject.net).

This is a work in progress.  However, it actually works: see the [Demo](https://github.com/daveho/FunWithSound/blob/master/FunWithSound/demo/io/daveho/funwithsound/demo/Demo.java) and [Demo2]((https://github.com/daveho/FunWithSound/blob/master/FunWithSound/demo/io/daveho/funwithsound/demo/Demo2.java) programs for a quick and dirty example.  The integration with Processing hasn't been started yet.

The project depends on [Gervill4Beads](https://github.com/daveho/Gervill4Beads).  To run the code, just have both projects checked out in the same Eclipse workspace.

The code is distributed under the [MIT license](https://github.com/daveho/FunWithSound/blob/master/LICENSE.txt).
