FunWithSound
============

Library intended to make it easy to make music using [Processing](http://processessing.org) and [Beads](http://www.beadsproject.net).  It can also be used from plain Java code.

This is a work in progress.  However, it actually works: see the [Demo](https://github.com/daveho/FunWithSound/blob/master/FunWithSound/demo/io/github/daveho/funwithsound/demo/Demo.java) and [Demo2](https://github.com/daveho/FunWithSound/blob/master/FunWithSound/demo/io/github/daveho/funwithsound/demo/Demo2.java) programs for a couple quick examples.

The integration with Processing has been started, but I don't know whether it works or not.  I'll find out soon and update this readme.

There is not really any documentation at the moment.  It will be coming soon.

The project depends on [Gervill4Beads](https://github.com/daveho/Gervill4Beads).  To run the code, just have both projects checked out in the same Eclipse workspace.  You'll need to run the `fetchlibs.sh` script in the Gervill4Beads directory to download all of the required libraries.

The code is distributed under the [MIT license](https://github.com/daveho/FunWithSound/blob/master/LICENSE.txt).
