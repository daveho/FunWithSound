FunWithSound
============

Library intended to make it easy to create music using [Processing](http://processessing.org) and [Beads](http://www.beadsproject.net).  It can also be used from plain Java code.

This is a work in progress.  However, it actually works: see the [Demo](https://github.com/daveho/FunWithSound/blob/master/FunWithSound/demo/io/github/daveho/funwithsound/demo/Demo.java) and [Demo2](https://github.com/daveho/FunWithSound/blob/master/FunWithSound/demo/io/github/daveho/funwithsound/demo/Demo2.java) programs for a couple quick examples.  Also, see the sketch [FWSDemo](https://github.com/daveho/FunWithSound/blob/master/FunWithSoundProcessingLib/examples/FWSDemo/FWSDemo.pde) for an example of using the library with Processing.  (Processing library download coming soon...)

There is not really any documentation at the moment.  It will be coming soon.

The project depends on [Gervill4Beads](https://github.com/daveho/Gervill4Beads).  To run the Java demos, just have both projects checked out in the same Eclipse workspace.  You'll need to run the `fetchlibs.sh` script in the Gervill4Beads directory to download all of the required libraries.

The code is distributed under the [MIT license](https://github.com/daveho/FunWithSound/blob/master/LICENSE.txt).
